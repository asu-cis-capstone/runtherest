repo for project runtherest

team members: Lei Jiang, Dejia Meng, Y Nguyen.

elevator pitch:
      Have you ever been to a restaurant that it took forever for the waiter to come and take your order? And then another long wait for the food to come out? 
      We tend to blame the waiter and tip them a little less than usual. But let’s think thoroughly, it’s the whole restaurant system that should be taken into account. 
      So the project idea is to create a fully integrated restaurant POS system, we called it Run the Rest. 
      This system fulfills all tasks from taking wait-lists, estimating wait time, organizing tables, taking and tracking order, communicating between the waiters and kitchen staffs, with advanced real-time reporting, and loyalty programs for regular customers. 

measurement plan:
       the time in minutes that it takes a user to accomplish a task.
       the quality of feedback obtained from users.
